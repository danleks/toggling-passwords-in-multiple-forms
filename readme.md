# Toggling passwords in multiple forms

In the first form, the #show-password checkbox should toggle the #password field visibility. In the second form, the #show-passwords checkbox should toggle the visibility of the #current-password and #new-password fields.

As an extra challenge, see if you can figure out a way to write your script without having to duplicate your code for each form (it’s ok if you can’t).
